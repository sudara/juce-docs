\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Use this struct as the template parameter for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_s_c_receiver_1_1_listener}{Listener}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_s_c_receiver_1_1_listener_with_o_s_c_address}{Listener\+With\+OSCAddress}} to receive incoming OSC data on the message thread. This should be used by OSC callbacks that are not realtime-\/critical, but have significant work to do, for example updating Components in your app\textquotesingle{}s user interface.

This is the default type of OSC listener. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}

build/juce\+\_\+osc/osc/\mbox{\hyperlink{juce___o_s_c_receiver_8h}{juce\+\_\+\+OSCReceiver.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
