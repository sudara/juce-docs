\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Automatically locks and unlocks a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock}{Read\+Write\+Lock}} object.

Use one of these as a local variable to control access to a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock}{Read\+Write\+Lock}}.

e.\+g. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock}{ReadWriteLock}} myLock;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{for} (;;)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keyword}{const} \mbox{\hyperlink{class_scoped_write_lock}{ScopedWriteLock}} myScopedLock (myLock);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// myLock is now locked}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    ...do some stuff...}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{// myLock gets unlocked here.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}

Creates a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_scoped_write_lock}{Scoped\+Write\+Lock}}.

As soon as it is created, this will call \mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock_a680913272878d262ab8dff16b3b5a4e7}{Read\+Write\+Lock\+::enter\+Write()}}, and when the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_scoped_write_lock}{Scoped\+Write\+Lock}} object is deleted, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock}{Read\+Write\+Lock}} will be unlocked.

Make sure this object is created and deleted by the same thread, otherwise there are no guarantees what will happen! Best just to use it as a local stack object, rather than creating one with the new() operator. \mbox{\Hypertarget{class_scoped_write_lock_a108b0a03c0b13ab6378b4ea68618d497}\label{class_scoped_write_lock_a108b0a03c0b13ab6378b4ea68618d497}}

Destructor.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_read_write_lock}{Read\+Write\+Lock}}\textquotesingle{}s exit\+Write() method will be called when the destructor is called.

Make sure this object is created and deleted by the same thread, otherwise there are no guarantees what will happen!
