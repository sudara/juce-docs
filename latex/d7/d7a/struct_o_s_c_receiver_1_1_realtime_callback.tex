\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Use this struct as the template parameter for \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_s_c_receiver_1_1_listener}{Listener}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_o_s_c_receiver_1_1_listener_with_o_s_c_address}{Listener\+With\+OSCAddress}} to receive incoming OSC data immediately after it arrives, called directly on the network thread that listens to incoming OSC traffic. This type can be used by OSC callbacks that don\textquotesingle{}t do much, but are realtime-\/critical, for example, setting real-\/time audio parameters. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
build/juce\+\_\+osc/osc/\mbox{\hyperlink{juce___o_s_c_receiver_8h}{juce\+\_\+\+OSCReceiver.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
