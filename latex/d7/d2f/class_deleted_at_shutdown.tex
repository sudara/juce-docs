\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Classes derived from this will be automatically deleted when the application exits.

After \mbox{\hyperlink{class_j_u_c_e_application_base_a318021f86bf379caeb4cb27c32f0f229}{JUCEApplication\+Base\+::shutdown()}} has been called, any objects derived from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_deleted_at_shutdown}{Deleted\+At\+Shutdown}} which are still in existence will be deleted in the reverse order to that in which they were created.

So if you\textquotesingle{}ve got a singleton and don\textquotesingle{}t want to have to explicitly delete it, just inherit from this and it\textquotesingle{}ll be taken care of.

It\textquotesingle{}s ok to delete these objects explicitly -\/ it\textquotesingle{}s only the ones left dangling at the end that will be deleted automatically.
