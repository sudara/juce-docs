Most system package managers have packages for CMake, but we recommend using the most recent release from \href{https://cmake.org/download}{\texttt{ https\+://cmake.\+org/download}}. You should always use a CMake that\textquotesingle{}s newer than your build toolchain, so that CMake can identify your build tools and understand how to invoke them.

In addition to CMake you\textquotesingle{}ll need a build toolchain for your platform, such as Xcode or MSVC.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md2}
\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Using $<$tt$>$add\+\_\+subdirectory$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md3}
The simplest way to include JUCE in your project is to add JUCE as a subdirectory of your project, and to include the line {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory(\+JUCE)} in your project CMake\+Lists.\+txt. This will make the JUCE targets and helper functions available for use by your custom targets.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Using $<$tt$>$find\+\_\+package$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md4}
To install JUCE globally on your system, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to tell CMake where to place the installed files. \begin{DoxyVerb}# Go to JUCE directory
cd /path/to/clone/JUCE
# Configure build with library components only
cmake -B cmake-build-install -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/JUCE/install
# Run the installation
cmake --build cmake-build-install --target install
\end{DoxyVerb}
 In your project which consumes JUCE, make sure the project CMake\+Lists.\+txt contains the line {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package(\+JUCE CONFIG REQUIRED)}. This will make the JUCE modules and CMake helper functions available for use in the rest of your build. Then, run the build like so\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}# Go to project directory
cd /path/to/my/project
# Configure build, passing the JUCE install path you used earlier
cmake -B cmake-build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/JUCE/install
# Build the project
cmake --build cmake-build
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Example projects}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md5}
In the JUCE/examples/\+CMake directory, you\textquotesingle{}ll find example projects for a GUI app, a console app, and an audio plugin. You can simply copy one of these subdirectories out of the JUCE repo, add JUCE as a submodule, and uncomment the call to {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory} where indicated in the CMake\+Lists.\+txt. Alternatively, if you\textquotesingle{}ve installed JUCE using a package manager or the CMake install target, you can uncomment the call to {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package}.

Once your project is set up, you can generate a build tree for it in the normal way. To get started, you might invoke CMake like this, from the new directory you created. \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -Bbuild (-GgeneratorName) (-DJUCE_BUILD_EXTRAS=ON) (-DJUCE_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This will create a build tree in a directory named \textquotesingle{}build\textquotesingle{}, using the CMake\+Lists in the current working directory, using the default generator (makefiles on mac/linux, and the most recent Visual Studio on Windows). You can choose a specific generator to use with the {\ttfamily -\/G} flag (call {\ttfamily cmake -\/G} to see a full list of generators on your platform). If you included JUCE as a subdirectory, you can enable the Extras and Examples targets by including the last two arguments (they\textquotesingle{}re off by default). There\textquotesingle{}s quite a lot of example projects, and generating project files might take a bit longer when these options are on, so you probably won\textquotesingle{}t want to include them most of the time.

Then, to build the project\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake --build build (--target targetNameFromCMakeLists) (--config Release/Debug/...)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This tells cmake to build the target named {\ttfamily target\+Name\+From\+CMake\+Lists}, in the specified configuration, using the appropriate tool. Of course, if you generated makefiles or ninja files, you could call {\ttfamily make} or {\ttfamily ninja} in the build directory. If you generated an IDE project, like an Xcode or Visual Studio project, then you could open the generated project in your IDE.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Building for i\+OS}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md6}
To build for i\+OS, you\textquotesingle{}ll need CMake 3.\+14 or higher. Using the Xcode generator is highly recommended, as other generators may not automatically find the correct SDK for the i\+Phone simulator, and may fail to run certain parts of the build, such as compiling icons and processing the app\textquotesingle{}s plist. By default, CMake will build for the same system that originally configured the project, so to enable cross-\/compilation for i\+OS, a few extra flags must be passed to the initial CMake invocation\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -Bbuild-ios -GXcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=9.3
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Here we create a build tree in the directory named \textquotesingle{}build-\/ios\textquotesingle{}, using the Xcode generator. The {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+SYSTEM\+\_\+\+NAME=i\+OS} option tells CMake to enable cross-\/compiling for i\+OS. The {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+OSX\+\_\+\+DEPLOYMENT\+\_\+\+TARGET=9.\+3} option sets the minimum deployment target (it applies to i\+OS despite the \textquotesingle{}OSX\textquotesingle{} in the variable name!).

Once the project has generated, we can open it as normal in Xcode (look for the project file in the build directory). Alternatively, to build from the command-\/line, we could run this command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake --build build-ios --target <targetName> -- -sdk iphonesimulator
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Here, we\textquotesingle{}re building the target named {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}target\+Name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} from the build tree in the directory {\ttfamily build-\/ios}. All the arguments after {\ttfamily -\/-\/} are ignored by CMake, and are passed through to the underlying build tool. In this case, the build tool will be {\ttfamily xcodebuild} because we used the Xcode generator above. We tell xcodebuild that we\textquotesingle{}re building the app for the i\+OS simulator, which doesn\textquotesingle{}t require special code signing.

If we wanted to build for a real device, we would need to pass some extra signing details to the initial CMake configuration command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake -Bbuild-ios -GXcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=9.3 \
    -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="iPhone Developer"
    -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<10 character id>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The {\ttfamily CODE\+\_\+\+SIGN\+\_\+\+IDENTITY} is the kind of certificate you want to use (i\+Phone Developer is appropriate for development) and {\ttfamily DEVELOPMENT\+\_\+\+TEAM} is the 10-\/character ID that can be found by opening the Keychain Access app, finding your development certificate, and checking its \textquotesingle{}Organizational Unit\textquotesingle{} info field.

When building the target, you may also need to tell Xcode that it can automatically update provisioning profiles, which is achieved by passing the {\ttfamily -\/allow\+Provisioning\+Updates} flag\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake --build build-ios --target <targetName> -- -allowProvisioningUpdates
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Archiving for i\+OS}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md7}
CMake\textquotesingle{}s out-\/of-\/the-\/box archiving behaviour doesn\textquotesingle{}t always work as expected, especially for targets that depend on custom static libraries. Xcode may generate these libraries into a \textquotesingle{}Derived\+Data\textquotesingle{} directory, but then omit this directory from the library search paths later in the build.

If the \char`\"{}\+Product -\/$>$ Archive\char`\"{} action isn\textquotesingle{}t working due to missing staticlibs, try setting the {\ttfamily ARCHIVE\+\_\+\+OUTPUT\+\_\+\+DIRECTORY} property explicitly\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}set_target_properties(my_static_lib_target PROPERTIES ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "./")
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Note that the static library produced by {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+binary\+\_\+data} automatically sets this property.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{Building universal binaries for mac\+OS}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md8}
Building universal binaries that will run on both arm64 and x86\+\_\+64 can be achieved by configuring the CMake project with {\ttfamily \char`\"{}-\/\+DCMAKE\+\_\+\+OSX\+\_\+\+ARCHITECTURES=arm64;x86\+\_\+64\char`\"{}}.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{Building with Clang on Windows}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md9}
Clang-\/cl (Clang with MSVC-\/like command-\/line) should work by default. If you are generating a Visual Studio project, and have installed the LLVM package which is distributed with Visual Studio, then you can configure a Clang-\/cl build by passing \char`\"{}-\/\+T Clang\+CL\char`\"{} on your configuration commandline.

If you wish to use Clang with GNU-\/like command-\/line instead, you can pass {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+COMPILER=clang++} and {\ttfamily -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+COMPILER=clang} on your configuration commandline. clang++ and clang must be on your {\ttfamily PATH} for this to work. Only more recent versions of CMake support Clang\textquotesingle{}s GNU-\/like command-\/line on Windows. CMake 3.\+12 is not supported, CMake 3.\+15 has support, CMake 3.\+20 or higher is recommended. Note that CMake doesn\textquotesingle{}t seem to automatically link a runtime library when building in this configuration, but this can be remedied by setting the {\ttfamily MSVC\+\_\+\+RUNTIME\+\_\+\+LIBRARY} property. See the \href{https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/prop_tgt/MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html}{\texttt{ official documentation}} of this property for usage recommendations.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{A note about compile definitions}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md10}
Module options and plugin options that would previously have been set in the Projucer can be set on a target-\/by-\/target basis in CMake, via {\ttfamily target\+\_\+compile\+\_\+definitions}. To find the options exposed by a particular module, check its module header for sections with the following structure\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}/** Config: NAME_OF_KEY
    Docs go here...
*/
#ifndef NAME_OF_KEY
 #define NAME_OF_KEY ...
#endif
\end{DoxyVerb}
 To override the default config option, use the following CMake code, replacing {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}value\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} as appropriate\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}target_compile_definitions(my_target PUBLIC NAME_OF_KEY=<value>)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The {\ttfamily Juce\+Plugin\+\_\+\+Preferred\+Channel\+Config} preprocessor definition for plugins is difficult to specify in a portable way due to its use of curly braces, which may be misinterpreted in Linux/\+Mac builds using the Ninja/\+Makefile generators. It is recommended to avoid this option altogether, and to use the newer buses API to specify the desired plugin inputs and outputs.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{API Reference}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md11}
\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Options}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md12}
These flags can be enabled or disabled to change the behaviour of parts of the JUCE build.

These options would normally be configured by either\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Supplying an option in the form {\ttfamily -\/DNAME\+\_\+\+OF\+\_\+\+OPTION=ON/\+OFF} to the initial CMake configuration call, or
\item Calling {\ttfamily set(NAME\+\_\+\+OF\+\_\+\+OPTION ON/\+OFF)} before including JUCE in your project via {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory} or {\ttfamily find\+\_\+package}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$\+JUCE\+\_\+\+BUILD\+\_\+\+EXTRAS$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md13}
This controls whether targets are added for the projects in the \textquotesingle{}extras\textquotesingle{} folder, such as the Projucer and Audio\+Plugin\+Host. This is off by default, because you probably won\textquotesingle{}t need these targets if you\textquotesingle{}ve included JUCE in your own project.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$\+JUCE\+\_\+\+BUILD\+\_\+\+EXAMPLES$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md14}
This controls whether targets are added for the projects in the \textquotesingle{}examples\textquotesingle{} folder, such as the Demo\+Runner and PIPs. This is off by default, because you probably won\textquotesingle{}t need these targets if you\textquotesingle{}ve included JUCE in your own project.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$\+JUCE\+\_\+\+ENABLE\+\_\+\+MODULE\+\_\+\+SOURCE\+\_\+\+GROUPS$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md15}
This option will make module source files browsable in IDE projects. It has no effect in non-\/\+IDE projects. This option is off by default, as it will increase the size of generated IDE projects and might slow down configuration a bit. If you enable this, you should probably also add {\ttfamily set\+\_\+property(\+GLOBAL PROPERTY USE\+\_\+\+FOLDERS YES)} to your top level CMake\+Lists as this is required for source grouping to work.

Source groupings are a little sensitive to the project layout. As such, you should always ensure that the call to {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+module} which adds a specific module happens {\itshape before} calling {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+$\ast$} to add any dependent targets.

The modules will be placed in a group named \char`\"{}\+JUCE Modules\char`\"{} within the group for each target, alongside the \char`\"{}\+Source Files\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Header Files\char`\"{} groups.

Note\+: Source groups will only work when all JUCE-\/dependent targets are created using the {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+$\ast$} functions. The standard {\ttfamily add\+\_\+executable} and {\ttfamily add\+\_\+library} commands are likely to result in broken builds when source groups are enabled!\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$\+JUCE\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md16}
Controls whether plugin targets should be installed to the system after building. Note that the plugin folders may be protected, so the build may require elevated permissions in order for the installation to work correctly, or you may need to adjust the permissions of the destination folders.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsection{Functions}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md17}

\begin{DoxyVerb}juce_add_gui_app(<target> [KEY value]...)
juce_add_console_app(<target> [KEY value]...)
juce_add_plugin(<target> [KEY value]...)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+gui\+\_\+app} and {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+console\+\_\+app} add an executable target with name {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}target\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}. {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+plugin} adds a \textquotesingle{}shared code\textquotesingle{} static library target with name {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}target\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, along with extra targets for each of the specified plugin formats. Each of these functions also takes a number of optional arguments in the form of a {\ttfamily KEY} followed by one or more {\ttfamily value}s which can be used to set additional attributes of the target. If these optional arguments aren\textquotesingle{}t specified, their values will fall back to sensible defaults.

Each of these arguments adds a property to the resulting target in the form {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+param\+Name}, where {\ttfamily param\+Name} is one of the parameter keys below. For example, after a call to {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+gui\+\_\+app(my\+\_\+target PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME \char`\"{}\+Target\char`\"{})}, the target {\ttfamily my\+\_\+target} will have a property named {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME} with the value {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Target\char`\"{}}. After creating a target with one of these commands, properties beginning with {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+} can be {\itshape queried}, but changing their values might not have any effect (or might even break things in unexpected ways!), so always pass JUCE target attributes directly to these creation functions, rather than adding them later.

{\ttfamily PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name of the output built by this target, similar to CMake\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily OUTPUT\+\_\+\+NAME} property. If not specified, this will default to the target name.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily VERSION}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A version number string in the format \char`\"{}major.\+minor.\+bugfix\char`\"{}. If not specified, the {\ttfamily VERSION} of the project containing the target will be used instead. On Apple platforms, this is the user-\/facing version string. This option corresponds to the {\ttfamily CFBundle\+Short\+Version\+String} field in the target\textquotesingle{}s plist.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily BUILD\+\_\+\+VERSION}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A version number string in the format \char`\"{}major.\+minor.\+bugfix\char`\"{}. If not specified, this will match the {\ttfamily VERSION} of the target. On Apple platforms, this is the private version string used to distinguish between App Store builds. This option corresponds to the {\ttfamily CFBundle\+Version} field in the target\textquotesingle{}s plist.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily BUNDLE\+\_\+\+ID}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An identifier string in the form \char`\"{}com.\+yourcompany.\+productname\char`\"{} which should uniquely identify this target. Mainly used for mac\+OS builds. If not specified, a default will be generated using the target\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME} and {\ttfamily PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME}.

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name of this target\textquotesingle{}s author. Will be added to the app/plugin\textquotesingle{}s Info.\+plist, and may be used to generate part of the {\ttfamily BUNDLE\+\_\+\+ID} if no ID was given explicitly. The value of this argument will be inherited from the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME} property, so if you want to use the same {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME} for several targets in a build tree, you can call {\ttfamily set\+\_\+directory\+\_\+properties(\+PROPERTIES JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME ...)} after including JUCE but before adding the targets, and then omit the {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+NAME} argument when creating the individual targets.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+WEBSITE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The address of a website related to this target in some way. The value of this argument will be inherited from the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+WEBSITE} property, so if you want to use the same {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+WEBSITE} for several targets in a build tree, you can call {\ttfamily set\+\_\+directory\+\_\+properties(\+PROPERTIES JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+WEBSITE ...)} after including JUCE but before adding the targets, and then omit the {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+WEBSITE} argument when creating the individual targets.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+EMAIL}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An email address for this target\textquotesingle{}s author. The value of this argument will be inherited from the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+EMAIL} property, so if you want to use the same {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+EMAIL} for several targets in a build tree, you can call {\ttfamily set\+\_\+directory\+\_\+properties(PROPERTIES JUCE\+\_\+\+COMPANY\+\_\+\+EMAIL ...)} after including JUCE but before adding the targets, and then omit the {\ttfamily COMPANY\+\_\+\+EMAIL} argument when creating the individual targets.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily DOCUMENT\+\_\+\+EXTENSIONS}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_file}{File}} extensions that should be associated with this target. For example, the Projucer passes the string {\ttfamily jucer} because it wants to open {\ttfamily .jucer} files. If your target has several different document types, you can pass them as multiple arguments, e.\+g. {\ttfamily DOCUMENT\+\_\+\+EXTENSIONS wav mp3 aif}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily NEEDS\+\_\+\+CURL}

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily NEEDS\+\_\+\+WEB\+\_\+\+BROWSER}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On Linux, JUCE may or may not need to link to Webkit depending on the compile definitions that are set on a JUCE target. By default, we don\textquotesingle{}t link Webkit because you might not need it, but if you get linker or include errors that reference Webkit, just set this argument to {\ttfamily TRUE}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily NEEDS\+\_\+\+STORE\+\_\+\+KIT}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On mac\+OS, JUCE may or may not need to link to Store\+Kit depending on the compile definitions that are set on a JUCE target. By default, we don\textquotesingle{}t link Store\+Kit because you might not need it, but if you get linker or include errors that reference Store\+Kit, just set this argument to {\ttfamily TRUE}.

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily APP\+\_\+\+SANDBOX\+\_\+\+ENABLED}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enables mac\+OS\textquotesingle{} app sandbox for this target. False by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily APP\+\_\+\+SANDBOX\+\_\+\+INHERIT}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Allows child processes to inherit the static entitlements of their parent process. If this is set to {\ttfamily TRUE}, no other app sandbox entitlements will be set on this target.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A string to insert into an app/plugin\textquotesingle{}s Info.\+plist.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily FORMATS}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For plugin targets, specifies the plugin targets to build. Should be provided as a space-\/separated list. Valid values are {\ttfamily Standalone Unity VST3 AU AUv3 AAX VST}. {\ttfamily AU} and {\ttfamily AUv3} plugins will only be enabled when building on mac\+OS. It is an error to pass {\ttfamily AAX} or {\ttfamily VST} without first calling {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+set\+\_\+aax\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+path} or {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+set\+\_\+vst2\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+path} respectively.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily PLUGIN\+\_\+\+NAME}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name of the plugin. In a DAW environment, this is the name that will be displayed to the user when they go to load a plugin. This name may differ from the name of the physical plugin file (to set the name of the plugin file, use the {\ttfamily PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME} option). If not specified, the {\ttfamily PLUGIN\+\_\+\+NAME} will default to match the {\ttfamily PRODUCT\+\_\+\+NAME}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily PLUGIN\+\_\+\+MANUFACTURER\+\_\+\+CODE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A four-\/character unique ID for your company. For AU compatibility, this must contain at least one upper-\/case letter. Garage\+Band 10.\+3 requires the first letter to be upper-\/case, and the remaining letters to be lower-\/case.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily PLUGIN\+\_\+\+CODE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A four-\/character unique ID for your plugin. For AU compatibility, this must contain exactly one upper-\/case letter. Garage\+Band 10.\+3 requires the first letter to be upper-\/case, and the remaining letters to be lower-\/case.

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily EDITOR\+\_\+\+WANTS\+\_\+\+KEYBOARD\+\_\+\+FOCUS}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Whether the plugin requires keyboard focus, or should defer all keyboard handling to the host.

\item Whether the AAX multi mono bus layout should be disabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+\+IDENTIFIER}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The bundle ID for the AAX plugin target. Matches the {\ttfamily BUNDLE\+\_\+\+ID} by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AU\+\_\+\+EXPORT\+\_\+\+PREFIX}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A prefix for the names of entry-\/point functions that your component exposes. Typically this will be a version of your plugin\textquotesingle{}s name that can be used as part of a C++ token. Defaults to your plugin\textquotesingle{}s name with the suffix \textquotesingle{}AU\textquotesingle{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AU\+\_\+\+SANDBOX\+\_\+\+SAFE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item May be either TRUE or FALSE. Adds the appropriate entries to an AU plugin\textquotesingle{}s Info.\+plist.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily SUPPRESS\+\_\+\+AU\+\_\+\+PLIST\+\_\+\+RESOURCE\+\_\+\+USAGE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item May be either TRUE or FALSE. Defaults to FALSE. Set this to TRUE to disable the {\ttfamily resource\+Usage} key in the target\textquotesingle{}s plist. This is useful for AU plugins that must access resources which cannot be declared in the resource\+Usage block, such as UNIX domain sockets. In particular, PACE-\/protected AU plugins may require this option to be enabled in order for the plugin to load in Garage\+Band.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+\+CATEGORY}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Should be one or more of\+: {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+None}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+EQ}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Dynamics}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Pitch\+Shift}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Reverb}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Delay}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Modulation}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Harmonic}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Noise\+Reduction}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Dither}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Sound\+Field}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+HWGenerators}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+SWGenerators}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Wrapped\+Plugin}, {\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+e\+Plug\+In\+Category\+\_\+\+Effect}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily PLUGINHOST\+\_\+\+AU}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item May be either TRUE or FALSE (defaults to FALSE). If TRUE, will add the preprocessor definition {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+PLUGINHOST\+\_\+\+AU=1} to the new target, and will link the mac\+OS frameworks necessary for hosting plugins. Using this parameter should be preferred over using {\ttfamily target\+\_\+compile\+\_\+definitions} to manually set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+PLUGINHOST\+\_\+\+AU} preprocessor definition.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily USE\+\_\+\+LEGACY\+\_\+\+COMPATIBILITY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+CODE}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item May be either TRUE or FALSE (defaults to FALSE). If TRUE, will override the value of the preprocessor definition \char`\"{}\+Juce\+Plugin\+\_\+\+Manufacturer\+Code\char`\"{} with the hex equivalent of \char`\"{}proj\char`\"{}. This option exists to maintain compatibility with a previous, buggy version of JUCE\textquotesingle{}s CMake support which mishandled the manufacturer code property. Most projects should leave this option set to its default value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Whether or not to install the plugin to the current system after building. False by default. If you want all of the plugins in a subdirectory to be installed automatically after building, you can set the property {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} on the directory before adding the plugins, rather than setting this argument on each individual target. Note that on Windows, the default install locations may not be writable by normal user accounts.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily VST\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The location to which VST2 (legacy) plugins will be copied after building if {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} is set on this target. If you want to install all of the VST2 plugins in a subdirectory to a non-\/default location, you can set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+VST\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} property on the directory before adding the plugin targets, rather than setting this argument on each individual target.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily VST3\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The location to which VST3 plugins will be copied after building if {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} is set on this target. If you want to install all of the VST3 plugins in a subdirectory to a non-\/default location, you can set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+VST3\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} property on the directory before adding the plugin targets, rather than setting this argument on each individual target.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AAX\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The location to which AAX plugins will be copied after building if {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} is set on this target. If you want to install all of the AAX plugins in a subdirectory to a non-\/default location, you can set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+AAX\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} property on the directory before adding the plugin targets, rather than setting this argument on each individual target.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily AU\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The location to which AU plugins will be copied after building if {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} is set on this target. If you want to install all of the AU plugins in a subdirectory to a non-\/default location, you can set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+AU\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} property on the directory before adding the plugin targets, rather than setting this argument on each individual target.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily UNITY\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The location to which Unity plugins will be copied after building if {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} is set on this target. If you want to install all of the Unity plugins in a subdirectory to a non-\/default location, you can set the {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+UNITY\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} property on the directory before adding the plugin targets, rather than setting this argument on each individual target. Unlike the other {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+DIR} arguments, this argument does not have a default value so be sure to set it if you have enabled {\ttfamily COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD} and the {\ttfamily Unity} format.

 Create a static library that embeds the contents of the files passed as arguments to this function. Adds a library target called {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} which can be linked into other targets using {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries}.

The {\ttfamily HEADER\+\_\+\+NAME} argument is optional. If provided, the generated header will be given the requested name, otherwise the generated header will be named \char`\"{}\+Binary\+Data.\+h\char`\"{}. In completely new projects, you should provide a unique name here, so that projects containing more than one binary data target are able to include the binary data headers without ambiguity.

The {\ttfamily NAMESPACE} argument is also optional. If not provided, the generated files will use the default namespace {\ttfamily Binary\+Data}. Each of the files located at the paths following {\ttfamily SOURCES} will be encoded and embedded in the resulting static library. This library can be linked as normal using {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries(\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}other\+Target\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} PRIVATE \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>})}, and the header can be included using {\ttfamily \#include \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Binary\+Data.\+h\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+bundle\+\_\+resources\+\_\+directory$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md20}

\end{DoxyVerb}
 Introspects the JUCE modules that have been linked to {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}target\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and generates a {\ttfamily Juce\+Header.\+h} which contains {\ttfamily \#include} statements for each of the module headers. This header also contains an optional {\ttfamily using namespace juce} statement, and an optional {\ttfamily Project\+Info} block, each of which can be disabled by setting the compile definitions {\ttfamily DONT\+\_\+\+SET\+\_\+\+USING\+\_\+\+JUCE\+\_\+\+NAMESPACE} and {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+DONT\+\_\+\+DECLARE\+\_\+\+PROJECTINFO} respectively. The resulting header can be included with {\ttfamily \#include \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Juce\+Header.\+h\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}. In plain CMake projects which don\textquotesingle{}t require Projucer compatibility, the use of Juce\+Header.\+h is optional.

 As an alternative to the JUCE\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD property, you may call this function to manually enable post-\/build copy on a plugin. The argument to this function should be a target previously created with {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+plugin}.

JUCE\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD will cause plugins to be installed immediately after building. This is not always appropriate, if extra build steps (such as signing or modifying the plugin bundle) must be executed before the install. In such cases, you should leave JUCE\+\_\+\+COPY\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+AFTER\+\_\+\+BUILD disabled, use {\ttfamily add\+\_\+custom\+\_\+command(\+TARGET POST\+\_\+\+BUILD)} to add your own post-\/build steps, and then finally call {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+enable\+\_\+copy\+\_\+plugin\+\_\+step}.

If your custom build steps need to use the location of the plugin artefact, you can extract this by querying the property {\ttfamily JUCE\+\_\+\+PLUGIN\+\_\+\+ARTEFACT\+\_\+\+FILE} on a plugin target ({\itshape not} the shared code target!).\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+\_\+set\+\_\+$<$kind$>$\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+path$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md23}

These functions should be called {\itshape before} adding any targets that may depend on the AAX/\+VST2/\+VST3 SDKs (plugin hosts, AAX/\+VST2/\+VST3 plugins etc.).\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+module$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md24}
\begin{DoxyVerb}juce_add_module(<path to module>)

\end{DoxyVerb}
 {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+module} adds a library target for the JUCE module located at the provided path. {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}path\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} must be the path to a module directory (e.\+g. /\+Users/me/\+JUCE/modules/juce\+\_\+core). This will add an interface library with a name matching the directory name of the module. The resulting library can be linked to other targets as normal, using {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries}.

Due to the way that {\ttfamily INTERFACE} libraries work in CMake, linking to a module added in this way {\itshape must} be done using {\ttfamily PRIVATE} visibility. Using {\ttfamily PUBLIC} will cause the module sources to be added both to the target\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily SOURCES} and {\ttfamily INTERFACE\+\_\+\+SOURCES}, which may result in many copies of the module being built into a single target, which would cause build failures in the best case and silent ODR violations in the worst case. Scary stuff!

This command has a few optional arguments\+: {\ttfamily INSTALL\+\_\+\+PATH} is a path, relative to the install prefix, to which the module sources will be copied during installation of the module. ALIAS\+\_\+\+NAMESPACE will add an alias for the module target(s) with the provided namespace. For example, the following invocation will add a module target named {\ttfamily my\+\_\+module}, along with an alias named {\ttfamily company\+::my\+\_\+module}. {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+module(my\+\_\+module ALIAS\+\_\+\+NAMESPACE company)\`{}}

{\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+modules} is a convenience function that can be used to add multiple JUCE modules at once. This version accepts many module paths, rather than just one. For an example of usage, see the CMake\+Lists in the {\ttfamily modules} directory.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+pip$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md25}
\begin{DoxyVerb}juce_add_pip(<header>)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This function parses the PIP metadata block in the provided header, and adds appropriate build targets for a console app, GUI app, or audio plugin. For audio plugin targets, it builds as many plugin formats as possible. To build AAX or VST2 targets, call {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+set\+\_\+aax\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+path} and/or {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+set\+\_\+vst2\+\_\+sdk\+\_\+path} {\itshape before} calling {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+pip}.

This is mainly provided to build the built-\/in example projects in the JUCE repo, and for building quick proof-\/of-\/concept demo apps with minimal set-\/up. For any use-\/case more complex than a proof-\/of-\/concept, you should prefer the {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+gui\+\_\+app}, {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+plugin}, or {\ttfamily juce\+\_\+add\+\_\+console\+\_\+app} functions, which provide more fine-\/grained control over the properties of your target.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+\_\+disable\+\_\+default\+\_\+flags$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md26}

\begin{DoxyVerb}target_link_libraries(myTarget PUBLIC juce::juce_recommended_warning_flags)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This is a target which can be linked to other targets using {\ttfamily target\+\_\+link\+\_\+libraries}, in order to enable the recommended JUCE warnings when building them.

This target just sets compiler and linker flags, and doesn\textquotesingle{}t have any associated libraries or include directories. When building plugins, it\textquotesingle{}s probably desirable to link this to the shared code target with {\ttfamily PUBLIC} visibility, so that all the plugin wrappers inherit the same compile/link flags.\hypertarget{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$tt$>$juce\+::juce\+\_\+recommended\+\_\+config\+\_\+flags$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_build__c_make__a_p_i_autotoc_md29}
